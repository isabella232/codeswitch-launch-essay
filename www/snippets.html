	<p>Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, is currently enjoying stratospheric approval numbers at home, mostly in the wake of his response to Hurricane Sandy and the damage it brought to the Garden State. He is heavily favored to win re-election this year against state Sen. Barbara Buono, his likely Democratic opponent, who in a recent Monmouth University poll trails the governor by only 42 points. He is thought to be seriously considering a bid for the White House in 2016.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-14" class="note-trigger">14</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-14-target">
		14. Here's a note in the margin to supplement the main text. It's cool.
