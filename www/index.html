						<p class="byline">By Gene Demby</p>


						<p class="oversize"><span class="dropcap">B</span>rooklyn Park, which sits just to the northwest of Minneapolis and hugs the Mississippi River, was once the quintessential American suburb: Pretty sleepy. Midwestern. Mostly white. Jesse Ventura, the garrulous former Minnesota governor and pro wrestler, used to be the city’s mayor. It was the childhood stomping grounds of A Prairie Home Companion’s Garrison Keillor.</p>

						<p>“The Wonder Years” could have been set  in Brooklyn Park.</p>

						<p>But over the past two decades, the city has undergone the kind of transformation that’s changing life in so many American suburbs: it became very brown, very quickly. In 1990, around nine in 10 people in Brooklyn Park were white. By 2010, nearly half the town’s residents were people of color.</p>

						<p>Longtime — mostly white — residents were either moving out or resisting the tide of newcomers. As the shift got underway in the mid-’90s, a white local bar owner spoke up at a City Council hearing: "If you come from a different perspective or a different place, don't bring those standards to Brooklyn Park.”<sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-1" class="note-trigger">1</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-1-target">
		<em>1.  Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>. May 31, 2004.</small>  To this day, folks in the surrounding area refer derisively to the town as  Brooklyn Dark.</p>

                        <p>This pattern seems familiar by now: ”they” invade, there’s tension, many of “us” leave. Whether it’s white folks gentrifying a brown community or brown folks ethno-fying a white one. And as long as the dichotomy was just that stark — as long as white folks and non-white folks could reliably play the roles of “we” and “they” — the pattern basically felt right.</p>

                        <p>But in today’s Brooklyn Park, there are too many “we”s and “they”s to keep track of: Fifteen percent of the population is Asian. Six percent is Hispanic or Latino. The 24 percent of the population that is black includes so many Liberian immigrants that the vice president of Liberia visited Brooklyn Park in 2012. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-2" class="note-trigger">2</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-2-target">Statistics from <a href="http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=27:2707966">the Census site</a> and <a href="http://stats.metc.state.mn.us/profile/detail.aspx?c=02393429#POPRACEETH">Minnesota’s Metropolitan Council</a>. The 2010 Census estimated there were about 18,500 African Americans in Brooklyn Park. In 2012, according to McClatchy, as many as 7,000 Liberian immigrants resided in the city.</small></p>

						<p>For most of American history, the country’s racial dynamics have been cast in these crudely black-and-white terms — with African Americans on one side, whites on the other, and everyone else falling onto some nebulous continuum in between.  But our country is now very much in technicolor, and many of our old ideas about its racial dynamics are getting scrambled.</p>

						<p>And people are kind of freaking out.</p>

						<p>You’ve probably heard the numbers before, but they bear revisiting: by 2043, the majority of the U.S. will be nonwhite, a fact that’s already true for Americans under the age of 13. The rising generation is already growing up in a distinctly different America, where those familiar black-and-white narratives already seem like distant history. Earlier in the 20th century, W.E.B. DuBois said that the problem confronting the U.S. over the next 100 years would be the color line. But in this 21st century, America’s major question might be just what happens as that line gets redrawn and gets blurrier.</p>

						<p>Demographic changes — even seismic ones like the ones the US is going through — happen over decades. It will be many years before this young, much more plural America starts to fully reveal patterns of employment, migration, housing and wealth. But these young folks are already starting to create culture, and it bears taking a close look at what they’re making to see how their ideas of race, ethnicity and cultural territory are beginning to play out.</p>

						<p>Exhibit A: the Harlem Shake. (We know you’re tired of hearing about it at this point. We feel you. But walk with us here.)</p>

                        <p>When the Harlem Shake meme was at its apex, it was absolutely inescapable. The absurdity lay in its simplicity: one person, usually in a ridiculous costume, would be dancing by themselves to Baauer’s “Harlem Shake” as the eponymous dubstep-y song ramped up. But then the beat dropped and boom:  everyone nearby was acting a fool and dancing, too.  Every day seemed to yield dozens more inspired and ridiculous takes on that idea — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG6p0z_W2Bo">people on planes</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkNrSpqUr-E">underwater</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhGFjtDteEs">on college quads</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmx_5es2tlI">in offices</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir2TdfSwH8g">in NBA locker rooms</a> recording themselves flailing about in ridiculous costumes, humping things, and gyrating goofily to Baauer’s hydrant of seemingly disconnected sounds.</p>

                        <p>But the videos got under a lot of people’s skins, and not just because of their ubiquity. The Harlem Shake — the real Harlem Shake — was a  dance that had been around for decades in the New York City neighborhood for which its named.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-3" class="note-trigger">3</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-3-target">It had a moment in the sun around 2001 when it was prominently featured in  the Diddy video, “Let’s Get It.”</small></p>

                        <p>Defenders of hip-hop culture rose up in protest: was this year’s viral video meme <a href="http://deadspin.com/5983963/dear-internet-you-are-not-doing-the-harlem-shake">just inaccurate labeling</a>? Was it mocking? Was it hijacking?</p>

                        <p>A defiant graffiti mural popped up on an uptown wall: <a href="http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/72334_212796558862282_1198187822_n.jpg">Do The Real Harlem Shake.</a></p>

                        <p>“This is about more than just the proper designation of a popular dance, it’s about cultural appropriation,” Melissa Harris-Perry, the MSNBC talk show host, said during a segment of her show about the Shake. “When communities create original art, they have a right to some creative control over its definition. If you enter a ballroom dancing competition, you’d better not cha-cha during the waltz. Creative interpretation is expected to respect certain boundaries. That’s what conveys the respect, and the wholesale application of a term Harlem Shake to flashmob boogie downs that are most definitely not the Harlem Shake? Let’s say that’s problematic.”</p>

                        <p><em>Problematic.</em> Many of the critiques of the Harlem Shake meme used that word to express displeasure with it; it was just blurry enough to be a catch-all for hodge-podge of anxieties that the whole phenomenon evokes. Several critics summoned a familiar narrative about appropriation: white kids, again, co-opting some piece of culture created by people of color.</small>  But just as in Brooklyn Park, something more complicated was happening with the Harlem Shake.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-4" class="note-trigger">4</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-4-target"><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2013/02/15/1601551/the-obscuring-of-black-culture-or-why-i-hate-the-fake-harlem-shake-meme/">Hayes Brown at ThinkProgress offers one example</a> of many: “The Harlem Shake is just the latest data point when it comes to the appropriation of black culture — especially music — and the white-washing that takes place once its conquered.”<br /><br />The anxieties roiling in the real Harlem are not unrelated to these critiques. Latinos from Washington Heights, just to the neighborhood’s north, are seriously challenging the established black political machine’s decades-long vise-grip on power. Young white professionals seeking relatively affordable Manhattan housing are flocking there in droves. And so in recent years, Harlem, as ready a shorthand as there is for black life in America, is rapidly becoming less, well, black. For a lot of people, Harlem is becoming someplace unfamiliar.</small></p>

                        <p>The initial video that sent the Harlem Shake viral was posted by a Japanese-American college student, <a href="http://qz.com/67991/you-didnt-make-the-harlem-shake-go-viral-corporations-did/">according to Quartz's Kevin Ashton</a>. The first copy — the one that set the template for the meme — wasn’t performed by a group of white kids in America, but a group of Australian surfers.</p>

                        <p>On Valentine’s Day, <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/stop-doing-the-fucking-harlem-shake">one American critic of the meme wrote</a>: “Whenever I look at an Internet full of (mostly) white people doing a bastardized version of a dance that has the same name as another dance (and lest we forget, is named after f----- Harlem) ... and people aren't finding it at least a little problematic, it makes me feels like I'm taking crazy pills.” </p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, in Egypt and Tunisia, the meme had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/28/the-harlem-shake-becomes-a-protest-in-egypt-and-tunisia/">become a vehicle for youth protests</a>. Four Egyptian students were arrested for performing the dance.</p>

                        <p>The old narratives don’t fit anymore. </p>

                        <p>Those old racial labels and categories were always pretty arbitrary and crudely applied. But they seem even more outmoded as the ways we self-define have become more more layered and our technologies have given us the ability to interact with and sample different bits of culture from anywhere. It’s much harder now to patrol the ramparts of our cultures, to distinguish between the appreciators and appropriators. Just who gets to play in which cultural sandboxes? Who gets to be the bouncer at the velvet rope?</p>

                        <p>Baauer (né Harry Rodrigues) lifted his song’s name from <a href="http://youtu.be/va-AY7jOh04?t=3m50s">a lyric by a Philly group called Plastic Little</a>, which referenced the aforementioned decades-old Harlem dance but was not actually <em>about</em> said dance. He also sampled a reggaeton song by Hector “El Father” Delgado. <sup class="footnote"><a href="#Action:highlight" id="fn-6" class="note-trigger">6</a></sup><small class="l-margin-right note" id="fn-6-target"><em>“Con los terroristas!”</em> (“With the terrorists!”)</small> Delgado and a rapper from Plastic Little were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/arts/music/baauers-harlem-shake-hits-no-1-with-unlicensed-samples.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">pressing Baauer’s record label to pay them</a> for the DJ’s unlicensed sampling of their music. Meanwhile, Baauer <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/49604-baauer-explains-azealia-banks-harlem-shake-squabble-working-with-alunageorge-on-new-ep/">was suing Azealia Banks</a>, the hipster rap darling, for releasing a song without his permission <a href="http://www.clipcartel.com/Azealia-Banks-Harlem-Shake-Remix-Official-Video.5783.html">in which she rhymes over his “Harlem Shake” beat</a>.</p>

                        <p>Oh, and where is Azealia Banks from? Harlem, of course.</p>

                    <p>Oakland is a whole continent away from Harlem and could either be a utopian vision of some multi-culti urban future or its dystopian, post-industrial present. For a long time, Oakland was the cultural anchor on the West Coast for black Americans. If Harlem gave us the Cotton Club and the Harlem Renaissance, then Oakland gave us the Black Panthers (and thus the modern gun rights movement), Sly and the Family Stone, a groundbreaking resolution on Ebonics. Oakland’s black population, tiny before World War II, exploded largely due to an influx of workers at the shipyards, maxing out around 47 percent of the population.</p>

                    <p>But now whites make up the biggest group — Oakland’s 34 percent white, 28 percent black, 25 percent Latino, and 17 percent Asian. It’s one of the few cities in the country with significant populations of several major groups. It’s become a haven for young, skinny-jeaned, creative-class types —  Forbes recently named the Uptown section <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mhj45jmeh/9-the-uptown-oakland-ca-2/">one of the 10 best hipster neighborhoods</a> in the country — all while the city remains pretty violent.  Although black people make up a little over a quarter of the city’s population, they made up three-fourths of its 128 homicides in 2012. Meanwhile, local television news crews are spending less time on the streets reporting on those crimes because <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/business/media/photojournalists-in-oakland-face-epidemic-of-camera-robberies.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">their equipment keeps being stolen</a>.  It’s a city with neighborhoods on alternate timelines.</p>

                    <p>The aforementioned Uptown used to be a hub of black life in the city.</p>

                    <p>“The Chocolate City notion — gone, gone, gone!” said Benjamin Bowser, a sociologist at California State University, East Bay.  “There are multiple cultures: chocolate, Vietnamese, you can’t even say Hispanic anymore, it’s Mexican and Salvadoran,  Nicaraguan. We even have enough people from Africa to say there’s Nigerians, Senegalese.”</p>

                    <p>What’s happening in Oakland is definitely gentrification, but it’s not the way we often think of gentrification. It’s not white people pushing out black folks; in Oakland, it’s black folks leaving of their own volition, black folks being pushed out, and <em>everyone</em> else moving in.</p>

                    <p>The old-fashioned models don’t necessarily apply.</p>

                    <p>When we usually think of appropriation, we usually think of white people taking an interest in some minority culture and profiting from it. Native Americans lost their lands, black people lost their personhoods, and all kinds of people of color were shut out from influence — including the ways they were portrayed in the popular culture.</p>

                    <p>Minstrel shows, in which white actors sang and danced in blackface , were enormously popular in the 1800s. The 1960’s saw the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1MOLzFpqrU">buffoonish, intermittently intelligible Mexican caricature Jose Jimenez</a> on The Steve Allen Show, while <a href="http://youtu.be/qbGuS6dyrG0?t=2m17s">Mickey Rooney donned big prosthetic teeth</a> and ching-chonged his way through Breakfast at Tiffany’s as Mr. Yunioshi. ("Miss Go-right-ry!”) </p>

                    <aside class="aside">
                        <img src="/_img/content/story/mickey_rooney.jpg"/>
                        <p class="small"><br/>Mickey Rooney in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>.</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>By the time Jimenez was, uh, uncorked, white folks dressing up like nonwhite folks had become a sturdy, time-tested American tradition. People write this stuff off now as just having been insensitive caricature, but these ideas propped up a bunch of ugly myths about nonwhites — too dumb, too lazy, too untrustworthy, too weird — that helped justify all kinds of discrimination.  It’s hard to just shrug off, say, Johnny Depp playing Tonto, when you’re living in all the messy context that’s been kneaded out.</p>

                    <p>But music was the form which most lent itself to being ripped off. In the early days of what we now think of as pop music, there were different charts for black and white music, and white acts could make a lot of money making whitebread versions of songs that black musicians had released, sometimes just weeks before. Pat Boone, who performed in venues and hawk products that black performers couldn’t, made his name and fortune doing so. </p>

                    <p><em>Damn,</em> folks thought. <em>We can’t have nothing for ourselves.</em></p>

                    <p>We’ve all tacitly agreed to pretend that whole Vanilla Ice thing never happened, but back in 1990, he  was the first rapper to ever hit number one on the Billboard charts, and at the time, a lot of people were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/03/arts/why-the-world-is-after-vanilla-ice.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm">very worried that hip-hop’s Elvis moment was upon it</a>. He faded into obscurity pretty quickly, so the storm blew over.  </p>

                    <p>But the landscape has shifted. There have been prominent white rappers since, but their prominence has relied on the imprimatur of black people for their cred — Eminem was Dr. Dre’s protegé, Timbaland rubber-stamped Bubba Sparxxx, and so on.</p>

                    <p>Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, a rap duo that hails from Seattle — a town not exactly known for churning out hip-hop hits, unless you count “Baby Got Back” — took over the Internet and the Billboard charts for a few weeks with “Thrift Shop,” his jaunty ode to the joys of, well, thrift shopping. It shot to number one on the Billboard charts and has more than 190 million views on YouTube, despite Macklemore not being signed to a major record label. Billboard’s Gary Trust wrote that Thrift Shop’s success on the charts and on radio came without much support from urban stations. In other words, it blew up without much support from the  black radio-listening audience.</p>

                    <p>Macklemore is a white dude rapping about the sweet joys of scoring dope secondhand clothes, and not to the audience that is traditionally thought of granting hip-hop its authenticity. How exactly did that happen?</p>

                    <p>“Unlike other white MC’s, [Macklemore’s] doing the ‘Portlandia’ thing,” said Josh Kun, a professor at the University of Southern California who writes about race and popular music. “He’s not fronting or trying to establish authenticity through blackness.”</p>

                    <p>Even though hip-hop is usually associated with black people, it’s been a multi-ethnic affair since its South Bronx beginnings, when blacks, Latinos and Caribbean immigrants were creating party music out of pieces of whatever they could find laying around in old record collections.  Latino rappers, for example, have rarely been seen as outsiders or interlopers. That’s in part because racial identity gets to be a little more fluid among people of color; the “brown people” umbrella can expand out pretty wide. But white rappers have always been viewed with some suspicion, and remain so.</p>

                    <p>But it’s now just the lingua franca and the background music for an entire generation of kids. And one of its dynamics — the idea of a marginalized group rapping about that marginalization  — has remained essentially intact as hip-hop has spread around the world, in part because marginalization is the narrative that teenagers everywhere assign themselves.</p>

                    <p>So if hip-hop is everywhere and everyone trafficks in it, who gets to decide when it’s real or not? What happens when hip-hop stops being black culture, but just youth culture?</p>

                    <p>Cecelia Cutler, a linguist at New York’s Lehman College, says that when nonblack kids traffic in hip-hop vernacular or African American vernacular English  — even  if they aren’t themselves hip-hop fans — they’re not trying to mimic blackness. They're calling upon pieces of it to signal (or “index,” as linguists like to say) some of the postures that people associate with hip-hop — coolness, toughness, hipness, swagger, <em>separateness</em>. Cutler said that in some circles, hip-hop inflected black speech had become a kind prestige English. The black part is being referenced, but its not quite the point.</p>

                    <p>Hip-hop’s ethos of omnivorousness  a major reason why pop culture’s become more “horizontal,” Kun said. “It’s been a long time since we’ve thought of hip-hop as an appropriator of things.”  Everybody is sampling everybody else.</p>

                    <p>H. Samy Alim, a linguist at Stanford, said that there’s a school of thought among scholars that holds that there’s no such thing as cultural ownership, that no bit of culture is off-limits from being glommed onto or lopped off and repurposed by someone from another group. But he says that the reasons this stuff makes folks so uncomfortable is because people are doing all this mixing and tinkering and reimagining in a world where there are real racial disparities in wealth and power and access.</p>

                    <p>But kids don’t seem to be too hung up on that stuff.</p>

                    <p>Chantal Garcia, a first-generation Mexican immigrant in Oakland who spoke to my Code Switch colleague Shereen Marisol Meraji, said that <span style="color:red">{FULL QUOTE COMING} people call it black music, but I just call it rap, I just call it what it is</span>.</p>

                    <p>Kun said his students are a lot less concerned with “proprietary histories,” the idea that certain people might have a unique claim to authentically interact with certain kinds of culture without being seen as appropriators,  than he himself might be.  “For the most part, the idea that this is original and authentic to something, they’re not so worried,” he said. “They’re like ‘Whatever, dude, it’s in my iTunes library. Can’t I just cut it up [to sample it]?’”</p>

                    <p>Kun said that outlook separates him from his students. “They tend to think of me as harping on race in terms of music,” he said.  “For a 17 or 18-year-old kid, who is Macklemore appropriating? We’re getting farther and farther away from the reference.”</p>

                    <p>Kun, confessing his discomfort with the idea, put it out there nonetheless:  “Maybe what we’re dancing around is that hip-hop has lost its identification with race.”</p>

                    <p>“When I was in the 8th grade, I had a do-rag and Timberlands, but that's because that was what was happening then,  that's what was going on in hip hop,” said Dumbfoundead, né Jonathan Park. “I been through all kinds of identities: that stoner s--- with Nirvana patches on my jacket, that was another one."</p>

                    <p>Dumb, as his people call him, is an  indie rapper from Los Angeles, and he ginned up some serious buzz two years ago for his song, “Are We There Yet.” It’s textbook contemporary hip-hop —  the bedding of a beautiful woman, the obligatory humblebrag about his success, and the anxieties that come with both — save for that first verse in recounting his mother’s epic escape through Korea and sneaking him over the Mexican border into the United States. In the video, he visually reps his Koreatown hood:</p>

                    <p>Dumb used to trek down to South Central and freestyle at this place with Apollo-like rules: if his stuff was weak, the crowd would boo and urge him to pass the mic.</p>

                    <p style="color:red">Everyone’s playing in the same cultural sandbox, picking up stuff. Some of the most prominent b-boy crews are made up of Asian-American kids. </p>

                    <p>When young people inherit the new America, hip-hop will be part of that birthright. The code-switching, the style-shifting, the swagger-jacking. But lest anyone think this new America will be some kind of Levi’s ad, it’s going to come in fits and starts. It’s going to be confusing.  And it’s going to be messy.</p>

                <figure class="l-media">
                    <img src="_img/content/story/william-bw.jpg" width="800" height="533" />

                    <p>“You can hear the new America in this community,” Alim said.</p>

                    <p>On one side of the tracks sits Palo Alto. It’s the home of Stanford University and the headquarters of Silicon Valley giants like Hewlett-Packard. It’s mostly white, and its residents have median household income in the six figures.</p>

                    <p>Alim, the Stanford linguist, says that something pretty significant is happening on the other side of the tracks in East Palo Alto. It’s a working class town and much browner; over the last two decades, the once mostly-black city has become predominantly Latino, with a large population of immigrants from Tonga, the Phillipines, and Fiji.</p>

                    <p>There’s a macedoine of languages represented in East Palo Alto. But when the young people from all these different groups are speaking to each other, Alim said, they’re conversing in hip-hop-inflected African American Vernacular English.</p>

                    <p>In other words, they’re talking like black people.</p>

                    <p>Again, as Cutler said, the kids aren’t trying to be black. They’re in part indexing the toughness and coolness that people associate with hip-hop, as Cecelia Cutler mentioned earlier. But Alim said that through their language, they’re also casting their lots away from certain ideas of whiteness.</p>

                    <p>“There’s an identification with that identity that as recognized as black but as more than black — as a class identity, as a regional identifier — as something ‘we’ do inside this community,” Alim said.</p>

                    <p>So once some piece of black American culture spreads out, and it starts taking on the contours of its new participants who come from somewhere else, when does it stop being black and just become this new thing? Where do the borders of one culture end and another begin?</p>

                    <p>Cutler wondered this, too.</p>

                    <p>“Why do we continue to call it African American English if African American English is being used by all kinds of different people?” she mused.</p>

                    <p>My friend Donwill, a black rapper from the group Tanya Morgan, said that he thought about the ramparts of hip-hop being open to everyone. “This isn't Microsoft where we have a guidebook and a code of conduct,” he said.  “Back when we were coming up, hip-hop was just like this except it was regional.”  There were always scenes and big artists in each scene. But now we're so connected that you can't be huge in only Seattle without the world finding you.</p>

                    <p>So we find ourselves having to assimilate and re-acclimate into these places we <em>thought</em> we knew and that we <em>thought</em> were ours.</p>

                    <p>The Afropunk skater in Philly, the Korean b-boy graffiti artist in Los Angeles, the bluegrass-loving Latino hipster in Austin, are inheriting an America in which they’ll have access to even more hyphens and more shadings in their self-definitions. That’s undoubtedly a good thing. But if you’re in Maricopa County, Ariz., and brown, the sheriff’s deputies won’t care whether you’re bumping Little Dragon in your ride when you’re pulled over. The way each of us experiences culture each day may be increasingly unmoored from genre, from geography, and yes, even from race, but America will not be easily untethered from the anchor of its history. We may be more equal, but mostly in our iPods.</p>

                    <p>In the next year, California and Texas, the nation’s most populous states, will  cease to have white majorities; both they, and the nation, are entering an age of pluralities.  As our suburbs become havens for immigrants looking for cheap housing and better schools, the people who lived there will fret about what they see as a difference in values.  And the rougher hoods in our big cities, once abandoned by the white middle class, are becoming havens for upwardly creative class types. The people who live in those once-overlooked enclaves don’t see the gastropubs and yoga studios as amenities but as harbingers of displacement from the homes they loved when no one else did.</p>

                    <p>How the country fares in the next century will be about how it deal with this churning. It will be determined by whether we grapple with the complications of some basic assumptions about our spaces — who gets to play and work and live in them and how they get to do that.</p>

                    <p>And so the Harlem Shake kerfuffle isn’t just about some hip-hop dance, but about these anxieties of ownership of the past and future, about generational tensions around acknowledgement,  respect and reverence, about the understandable if futile impulse to want culture to retain something like purity, about disparities in power both real and perceived, about land and property, about realness and authenticity and race and history.</p>

                    <p>For good or ill, the country our kids are creating will work by new, confounding rules, and the templates we’ve fallen back on in the past hold up less and less.</p>

                    <p>It’s the rest of us, those of us who’ve been here for awhile and who still find comfort with these old modes of viewing the world, who are going to have to assimilate. A Minnesota suburb that looks more like Brooklyn. A Harlem Shake that looks nothing like Harlem.</p>
